# Final Project Proposal

## User Story

As a person working from home due to quarantine,
I want an app that can help me effectively plan my break time,
So that I do not feel as though I am bored or wasting time.

## Description

The user can set a scheduled break time (or schedule multiple breaks), 
at the break time the user will be alerted and provided a fun mini game to help decide
on a productive activity to do on their break, for example meditating, exercise, reading, etc..
The goal is to prevent the user from feeling as though they have nothing to do and provide
positive alternatives to what they might default to on a break (i.e. browsing social media, watching youtube, shopping etc...)

Here is a powerpoint that explains more about our project: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1igBGOkI0RDcMXuq7DNI_NwBj7sHkc15I/view?usp=sharing

## Usage
![image](./client/src/images/downshift-demo.gif)  
The user will be provided a clock which they can set the time of their breaks on and save their scheduled break.
The user will be able to view their scheduled breaks on a separate page.
At the scheduled break the user will be alerted and shown a game which will help them to select
a productive way to spend their break time.
